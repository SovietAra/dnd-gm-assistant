## Summary
DnD GM Assistant is a tool that helps Game Masters and players analyze session transcripts from tabletop role-playing games and generate summaries, plot suggestions, and encounter ideas using LLMs. 

## Target
Designed to support multiple games, users (GMs and players), and flexible context-based analysis.

## Planned Features
Support for multiple games/campaigns

Each game has:
* a single GM
* multiple players
* multiple sessions
* Each session is tied to a game and contains a transcript

User roles determine output type:

* GM → plot hooks, NPCs, world events
* Player → personal summary, goals, quests

Support for "Idea mode": 
* submitting a prompt without context
